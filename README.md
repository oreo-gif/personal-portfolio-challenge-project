# personal-portfolio-challenge-project
this is the solution code to the personal portfolio page challenge project by free code camp

This project has 3 main features:-
1)My projects 
2)Internal navigation bar
3)Freecodecamp id link

I have added full screen backgrounds for different sections.I have linked my porject screenshots and links here, though I have failed in giving a proper connection to my projects.
I have linked the FCC icon to my id successfully.

This is my 5th mini project as a beginner. 
Reviews and corrections are welcomed!
